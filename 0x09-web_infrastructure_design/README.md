# 0x09. Web infrastructure design

## Learning Objectives

General:

- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
- You must be able to explain what each component is doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

### [0. Simple web stack](./0-simple_web_stack)

- A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack. On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.

Requirements:

- You must use:
  - 1 server
  - 1 web server (Nginx)
  - 1 application server
  - 1 application files (your code base)
  - 1 database (MySQL)
  - 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8
- You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
  - What is a server
  - What is the role of the domain name
  - What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
  - What is the role of the web server
  - What is the role of the application server
  - What is the role of the database
  - What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
- You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
  - SPOF
  - Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
  - Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

### [1. Distributed web infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure)

- On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

Requirements:

- You must add:
  - 2 servers
  - 1 web server (Nginx)
  - 1 application server
  - 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
  - 1 set of application files (your code base)
  - 1 database (MySQL)
- You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
  - For every additional element, why you are adding it
  - What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
  - Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
  - How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
  - What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
- You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
  - Where are SPOF
  - Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
  - No monitoring

### [2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure](./2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure)

- On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

Requirements:

- You must add:
  - 3 firewalls
  - 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
  - 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)
- You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
  - For every additional element, why you are adding it
  - What are firewalls for
  - Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
  - What monitoring is used for
  - How the monitoring tool is collecting data
  - Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
- You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
  - Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
  - Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
  - Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
