### [0. What is my PID](./0-what-is-my-pid)

- Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-what-is-my-pid
4120
```

### [1. List your processes](./1-list_your_processes)

- Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.
  - Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
  - Display in a user-oriented format
  - Show process hierarchy

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-list_your_processes | head -50

```

### [2. Show your Bash PID](./2-show_your_bash_pid)

- Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.
  - You cannot use pgrep
  - The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)

```sh
sylvain@ubuntu$ sylvain@ubuntu$ ./2-show_your_bash_pid
sylvain   4404  0.0  0.7  21432  4000 pts/0    Ss   03:32   0:00          \_ -bash
sylvain   4477  0.0  0.2  11120  1352 pts/0    S+   03:40   0:00              \_ bash ./2-show_your_bash_PID
sylvain   4479  0.0  0.1  10460   912 pts/0    S+   03:40   0:00                  \_ grep bash
```

### [3. Show your Bash PID made easy](./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy)

- Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.
  - You cannot use ps

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy
4404 bash
4555 bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy
4404 bash
4557 bash
```

### [4. To infinity and beyond](./4-to_infinity_and_beyond)

- Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

```
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
^C
```

### [5. Kill me now](./5-kill_me_now)

- We killed our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.
- Write a Bash script that kills 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.
  - You must use kill

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Terminated
```

### [6. Kill me now made easy](./6-kill_me_now_made_easy)

- Write a Bash script that kills 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.
  - You cannot use kill or killall

Terminal 0

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Terminated
```

Terminal 1

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./6-kill_me_now_made_easy
```

### [7. Highlander](./7-highlander)

- Write a Bash script that displays:
  - To infinity and beyond indefinitely
  - With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
  - I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
- Make a copy of your 6-kill_me_now_made_easy script, name it 67-kill_me_now_made_easy, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

Terminal 0

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond
^C
```

Terminal 1

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-kill_me_now_made_easy
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-kill_me_now_made_easy
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-kill_me_now_made_easy
```

- I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 67-kill_me_now_made_easy in terminal #1, for every iteration we can see I am invincible!!! appearing in terminal #0.

### [8. Beheaded process](./8-beheaded_process)

- Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal 0

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Killed
```

Terminal 1

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./8-beheaded_process
```

- I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 8-beheaded_process in terminal #1 and we can see that the 7-highlander has been killed.

### [9. Process and PID file](./100-process_and_pid_file)

- Write a Bash script that:
  - Creates the file /var/run/holbertonscript.pid containing its PID
  - Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
  - Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
  - Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
  - Deletes the file /var/run/holbertonscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./100-process_and_pid_file
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
^CY U no love me?!
```

Executing the 100-process_and_pid_file script and killing it with ctrl+c.

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./100-process_and_pid_file
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
I hate the kill command
```

Terminal 1

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo pkill -f 100-process_and_pid_file
```

Starting 100-process_and_pid_file in the terminal #0 and then killing it in the terminal #1.
