### [0. How many subs?](./0-subs.py)

- Write a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0.
- Requirements:

  - Prototype: `python def number_of_subscribers(subreddit)`
  - If not a valid subreddit, return 0.
  - NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.

```
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ cat 0-main.py
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    number_of_subscribers = __import__('0-subs').number_of_subscribers
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Please pass an argument for the subreddit to search.")
    else:
        print("{:d}".format(number_of_subscribers(sys.argv[1])))
```

```

wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 0-main.py this_is_a_fake_subreddit
0
```

### [1. Top Ten](./1-top_ten.py)

- Write a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.
- Requirements:

  - Prototype: `python def top_ten(subreddit)`
  - If not a valid subreddit, print None.
  - NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.

```
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ cat 1-main.py
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    top_ten = __import__('1-top_ten').top_ten
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Please pass an argument for the subreddit to search.")
    else:
        top_ten(sys.argv[1])
```

```

### [2. Recurse it!](./2-recurse.py)

- Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. If no results are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None.
- Requirements:

  - Prototype: `python def recurse(subreddit, hot_list=[])`
  - Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied. AKA you can add a counter, but it must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
  - If not a valid subreddit, return None.
  - NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.

```
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ cat 2-main.py
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    recurse = __import__('2-recurse').recurse
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Please pass an argument for the subreddit to search.")
    else:
        result = recurse(sys.argv[1])
        if result is not None:
            print(len(result))
        else:
            print("None")
```

```
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 2-main.py programming
932
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 2-main.py this_is_a_fake_subreddit
None
```

### [3. Count it!](./100-count.py)

- Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).

- Prototype: `def count_words(subreddit, word_list)`
  - Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied and a list of keywords. AKA you can add a counter or anything else, but the function must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
  - Results should be printed in descending order, by the count, and if the count is the same for separate keywords, they should then be sorted alphabetically. Words with no matches should be skipped and not printed.
    Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears, not titles it appears in. ‘java java java’ counts as 3 separate occurrences of java.
  - To make life easier, ‘java.’ or ‘java!’ or ‘java\_’ should not count as ‘java’
  - If no posts match or the subreddit is invalid, print a newline.
  - NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are NOT following redirects.

```
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ cat 100-main.py
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    count_words = __import__('100-count').count_words
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: {} <subreddit> <list of keywords>".format(sys.argv[0]))
        print("Ex: {} programming 'python java javascript'".format(sys.argv[0]))
    else:
        result = count_words(sys.argv[1], [x for x in sys.argv[2].split()])
```

```
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 100-main.py programming 'python java javascript scala no_results_for_this_one'
java: 27
javascript: 20
python: 17
scala: 4
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 100-main.py not_a_valid_subreddit 'python java javascript scala no_results_for_this_one'
wintermancer@lapbox ~/reddit_api/project $ python3 100-main.py not_a_valid_subreddit 'python java'
```
